##About me

I am third-year student of Inha University in Tashkent. Since the beginning of my dive into IT-technologies and programing, i am very interested in frontend developing.
That was a main reason for me to start to learn frontend in RS-school.

I hope that my efforts and course will help me to get useful knowledge in frontend and lead me to become strong Frontend developer.
